## About the project
This is a project I whipped up in a few days to play around with WinUI 3. I may do more with it in the future, but we'll see

## Building
To build, you need Visual Studio (2022 recommended) with the Win UI library installed. 
- **NOTE**: Do not remove file `Assets/CoolImages/spymom.png`. Even though it's not used anywhere, the project fails to build if it's not in there. I messed up somewhere, and I cannot fix it for now

## Dependencies 
- Microsoft.Windows.Sdk.Buildtools
- Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK
- System.Windows.Extensions
